# genetic-algorithm-py
# Sets
sets - old gene values

Set1 - charged + W without D and E\
Set2 - polar without charged\
Set3 - bulky\
Set4 - D\
Set5 - E\
Set6 - all other
# Pulls
pulls - new gene values\
Remember that new value not in charged or W

Pull1 - polar without charged\
Pull2 - all aa without charged and W\
Pull3 - D\
Pull4 - E
# Probs
probabilities of changing aa\
Last number is probability that mutation will be

Set1 - leave the old value\
Set2 - high probability from polar and to polar\
Set3 - low probability from bulky and high probability to polar\
Set4 - from D to E\
Set5 - from E to D
Set6 - from other aa to polar with high prob.
